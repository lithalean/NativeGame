## 📚 Key Patterns & Conventions Established
```swift
// NavigationStack Architecture Pattern
NavigationStack(path: $gameState.navigationPath) {
    // Root view (SplashScreen → TitleScreen)
    .navigationDestination(for: GameDestination.self) { destination in
        // Route to appropriate view
    }
}

// Modular Component Pattern
struct TitleScreen: View {
    var onNewGame: (() -> Void)     // Action injection
    var onContinue: (() -> Void)    // Enables reusability
    var onSettings: (() -> Void)    // Clean separation
}

// Design System Pattern
TitleButton.primary(title: "New Game", icon: "play.circle.fill", action: startGame)
TitleButton.secondary(title: "Settings", icon: "gearshape.circle.fill", action: showSettings)

// State Management Pattern
@Observable class GameStateManager {
    var navigationPath = NavigationPath()  // Type-safe routing
    func navigateToGame() { navigationPath.append(GameDestination.game) }
}

// File Organization Convention
Views/          # SwiftUI components (SplashScreen, TitleScreen, MainGameView)
Styles/         # Design system components (TitleButton, TitleBackground)
Managers/       # State and business logic (GameStateManager, PCKManager)
```
