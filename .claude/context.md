## 📚 Key Patterns & Conventions Established
```swift
// Sliding Panel Architecture Pattern
@Observable class SlidingPanelManager {
    var currentPanel: TitlePanelDestination = .main
    func navigateToPanel(_ destination: TitlePanelDestination) { /* smooth transitions */ }
}

// Dynamic Title Bar Pattern
struct DynamicTitleBar: View {
    let configuration: TitleConfiguration
    // Context-aware titles with smooth animations
}

// WWDC25 Component Pattern
struct MenuButton: View {
    // .ultraThinMaterial with proper strokes and shadows
    // Haptic feedback and scale animations
}

// Modular Design System Pattern
Styles/
├── MenuButton.swift          # WWDC25 glassmorphism menu button
├── TitleButton.swift         # Premium gaming action buttons
├── DynamicTitleBar.swift     # Context-aware title system
└── Background components     # Premium gradient backgrounds

// State Management Pattern
Views use Managers for state, Styles for appearance:
ModernSlidingTitleScreen(SlidingPanelManager) + DynamicTitleBar(TitleBarManager)
```
